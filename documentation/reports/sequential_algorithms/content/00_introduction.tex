\chapter{Introduction}

The following report shows performance analytics of several popular algorithms: Matrix multiplication, Gaussian elimination, Dijkstra, and Sieve of Eratosthenes, and several sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Bucket sort, Counting sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Selection sort.
The main goal was to review the time complexity of the algorithms when changing the dimensionality of the input data.
