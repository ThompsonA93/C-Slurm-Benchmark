\chapter{Discussion}

Two sorting algorithms, namely Counting Sort and Bucket Sort, did too well during the performance testing.
Despite further inspections, no significant indicator was found why these 2 algorithms would perform that well. 
It was assumed that this may be due to the maximum element value being 100.\\
All the other algorithms performed roughly as expected given complexity theory for squared and cubic functions.
