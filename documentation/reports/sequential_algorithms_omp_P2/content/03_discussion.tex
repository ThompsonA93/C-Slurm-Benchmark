\chapter{Discussion}

The results of parallelizing algorithms show significant changes in 
execution time at the cost of efficiency per process.

The speedup of Gaussian Elimination and Quicksort were the most 
remarkable, with up to 6x faster execution time,
with similarly low negative impact of efficiency per utilized processor, 
ranking from 10 to 25\%.
Dijkstra did not experience any significant boost with at most 0.1x 
improvement in execution time, but at extreme efficiency penalties 
of up to 90\%.
The Sieve of eratosthenes reached speedups of up to 3x, at the 
cost of up to 60\% processor efficiency.
