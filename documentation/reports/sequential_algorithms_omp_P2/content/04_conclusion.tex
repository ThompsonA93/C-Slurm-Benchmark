\chapter{Conclusion}

The OpenMP library enabled parallelism for algorithms of various kinds.
At times, it is difficult to understand the concepts running in the background
of the openMP library, yet it is easy to implement in an already-running project.
In comparison, POSIX threads would be significantly more complex to implement, 
but would have allowed deeper insights into the program's code and execution.
