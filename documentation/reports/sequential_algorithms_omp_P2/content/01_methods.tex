\chapter{Methods and Resources}

The algorithms were performed on a AMD EPYC 7702P 64-Core Processor 
via the programming language C and the library OpenMP.
The program implementations are available on 
\href{https://github.com/ThompsonA93/C-Slurm-Benchmark}{Github.com}.

The methodical approach was to run each program execution 
via different input parameters, ranging from different element 
dimension to varying amounts of threads utilized.
