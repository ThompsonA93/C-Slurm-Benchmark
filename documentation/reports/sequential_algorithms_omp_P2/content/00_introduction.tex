\chapter{Introduction}

The following report shows performance analytics of several popular algorithms including quick sort, gaussean elimination, sieve of eratosthenes and dijkstra.
The main goal was to review the time complexity of the algorithms when changing the dimensionality of the input data and the amount of threads computing the programs
and to analyze execution time, speedup and efficiency metrics.
