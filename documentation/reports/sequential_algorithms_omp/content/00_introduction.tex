\chapter{Introduction}

The following report shows performance analytics of several popular algorithms including matrix multiplication and 
the following sorting algorithms: bubble sort, bucket sort, counting sort, insertion sort, brick sort, and selection sort.
The main goal was to review the time complexity of the algorithms when changing the dimensionality of the input data and 
the amount of threads computing the programs.
